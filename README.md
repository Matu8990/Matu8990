Im Matias!:wink:

I am a lawyer and technology enthusiast

I began to venture into programming in the midst of the pandemic and now I am in the last year of my programming degree.

I hope to be able to apply these learnings to the practice of law and bring new tools to my colleagues.

In my free time I like to watch series and movies, but I also really enjoy video games. :sunglasses:
